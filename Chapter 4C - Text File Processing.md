Here is a concise yet thorough summary of the key concepts from the Text File Processing notes, presented in a way to aid your deep understanding:

# Text File Processing in Python

In Python, a text file can be thought of as a long string stored on disk. Python handles the different conventions for marking line endings across operating systems, using the newline character `\n` internally to indicate line breaks.

## File Paths
To access a file, you need to provide its *file path* - the route that tells your program where the file is located. File paths have one or more components separated by a special character (forward slash `/` on Unix, backslash `\` on Windows). 

In Windows, you need to either escape backslashes in a path string by doubling them `"\\"`, or use a raw string by putting `r` before the opening quote: `r"C:\path\file.txt"`.

Python's `os.path` module provides many useful functions for working with file paths:

- `os.path.abspath(path)` - returns the absolute path of a file
- `os.path.dirname(path)` - returns the directory portion of a path  
- `os.path.basename(path)` - returns just the filename portion of a path
- `os.path.isfile(path)` - checks if a path points to an existing file
- `os.path.isdir(path)` - checks if a path points to an existing directory

## Opening Files
Before you can read from or write to a file, you must first *open* it. Python's built-in `open()` function takes the file path and an optional access mode string:

```python
f = open('file.txt', 'r')  # open for reading (default) 
f = open('file.txt', 'w')  # open for writing, truncating the file first
f = open('file.txt', 'a') # open for writing, appending to the end
```

Adding `'+'` to the mode allows both reading and writing, e.g. `'r+'` opens for reading and writing.

`open()` returns a *file object* (also called a file handle) that you use to interact with the file. 

## Reading Files
You can read from a file object `f` using these methods:

- `f.read(size)` - reads up to *size* bytes, returning them as a string. With no argument, reads to end of file.  
- `f.readline()` - reads one line, returning it as a string
- `f.readlines()` - reads all lines into a list of strings

## Writing Files  
To write to a file object `f`:

- `f.write(string)` - writes the string to the file
- `f.writelines(list)` - writes a list of strings to the file

Remember to add `'\n'` to your strings to insert newlines.

## Closing Files 
Always close a file object when you're done with it using `f.close()`. This frees system resources and ensures all data is written. Unclosed files can cause data corruption!

The best way to open and close files is using Python's `with` statement, which automatically closes the file even if an exception occurs:

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
```

## Handling Exceptions
Many things can go wrong when working with files - the file might not exist, you may not have permission to access it, the disk could have an error, etc. These raise various exceptions like `FileNotFoundError`. 

It's important to use `try/except` blocks to gracefully handle potential file errors and prevent your program from crashing unexpectedly.

## Moving and Copying Files
Python's `shutil` module provides high-level file operations:

- `shutil.copy(src, dst)` - copies the file *src* to location *dst*  
- `shutil.move(src, dst)` - moves the file *src* to location *dst*

I hope this explanation helps solidify your understanding of processing text files in Python! Let me know if you have any other questions. I encourage you to practice working with files in your own programs to really internalize these concepts.
