# Software Development Fundamentals

## Computing
- Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers
- Computing is a family of disciplines addressing different kinds of computing problems

The 5 major computing disciplines:
<pre>
- Computer Engineering (CE): focus on hardware 
- Computer Science (CS): focus on software and theory
- Information Systems (IS): focus on information 
- Software Engineering (SE): focus on robust software  
- Information Technology (IT): focus on infrastructure
</pre>

- ACM provides computing curricula recommendations
- MQA accredits academic programs in Malaysia

## Algorithms
- An algorithm is a finite sequence of precise, well-defined steps that halts with a solution to a problem
- Algorithms enable automation of problem solving

## Information Processing
- Computing agents transform data (input) into information (output) per algorithms
- The Input-Process-Output (IPO) model explains data flow in computing
- Modern computers have hardware to execute algorithms in software

## Software Development
Software development is the process of creating software

It follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
<pre>
1. Planning
2. Requirements Gathering  
3. Analysis
4. Design
5. Development
6. Testing
7. Deployment
8. Maintenance  
</pre>

- The Waterfall model is one SDLC approach
- Other models: Incremental, Prototype, etc.
- Defects are costlier to fix in later SDLC stages
- Careful analysis, design and coding reduces costs

## Python Programming
- Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted language
- Supports multiple paradigms
- Simple, readable syntax 
- Extensive standard library
- Popular for many domains
- Continuously developed as open source
